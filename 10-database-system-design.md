## üß≠ Introduction to Database System Design

Database system design is the process of creating a robust and efficient backend for your application. It involves understanding the data flow, designing schemas, and ensuring the system can handle growth and failures.

> **Analogy:** Think of database design as building the foundation of a house. A strong foundation ensures the house can withstand storms and support future expansions.

## üîó Building a Short URL System

A short URL system is a classic example of database design. The goal is to map long URLs to shorter, more manageable ones.

### Key Components:
1. **URL Mapping Table:**
   - Store the original URL and its corresponding short code.
   - **Example Schema:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE urls (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
         short_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL
     );
     ```

2. **Generating Short Codes:**
   - Use hashing algorithms or base encoding to generate unique short codes.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     import hashlib
     def generate_short_code(url):
         hash_object = hashlib.md5(url.encode())
         return hash_object.hexdigest()[:6]
     ```

3. **Predictability Concerns:**
   - Avoid predictable short codes to prevent abuse (e.g., sequential IDs).

> **Tip:** Use random or hashed values for short codes to enhance security.

## üìà Designing for Scalability

Scalability ensures your database can handle increasing loads without degradation in performance.

### Strategies:
1. **Sharding:**
   - Distribute data across multiple servers based on a shard key.
2. **Partitioning:**
   - Split large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces.
3. **Caching:**
   - Use in-memory caches (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load.

**Example:**
A social media app might shard user data by region and partition posts by date.

> **Performance Tip:** Always monitor your system's bottlenecks before scaling horizontally.

## üõ°Ô∏è Handling Failures and Retries

Failures are inevitable in distributed systems. Design your system to handle them gracefully.

### Techniques:
1. **Retry Logic:**
   - Implement retries for transient failures.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def save_to_database(data, retries=3):
         for attempt in range(retries):
             try:
                 # Attempt to save data
                 return True
             except Exception as e:
                 if attempt == retries - 1:
                     raise e
     ```

2. **Draft Mode:**
   - Save failed operations as drafts and notify users to retry later.

> **Critical Insight:** Always log failures for debugging and monitoring.

## ‚è≥ Asynchronous vs Synchronous Operations

Choosing between asynchronous and synchronous operations impacts performance and user experience.

### Synchronous Operations:
- Block the user until the operation completes.
- **Example:** Saving a post immediately after submission.

### Asynchronous Operations:
- Perform tasks in the background.
- **Example:** Sending email notifications or processing analytics.

> **Analogy:** Synchronous operations are like waiting in line at a store, while asynchronous operations are like dropping off your dry cleaning and picking it up later.

## üë• Designing Social Features

Social features like "follow" relationships require careful schema design.

### Example: Follow Relationship
1. **Schema:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE follows (
       follower_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
       followee_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
       PRIMARY KEY (follower_id, followee_id)
   );
   ```

2. **Querying Followers:**
   - Retrieve followers or followees using simple JOINs.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT u.username
     FROM follows f
     JOIN users u ON f.follower_id = u.id
     WHERE f.followee_id = 1;
     ```

3. **Caching:**
   - Cache follower lists to reduce database load.

> **Tip:** Use denormalization or materialized views for frequently accessed data.
